# ofxTrinket
OpenFrameworks addon to communicate via USB with a [Trinket](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/introduction) board.
Since the Trinket is not able to handle a serial session, it must be configured as a HID device using [this approach](https://github.com/magiclab/trinketHidToggle).
